# crypto-data-api-and-analytics-dashboard
This product scrapes the web for the value of crypto currencies then serves the data through an api. This is a project which I did for the purpose of showing my youtube community <a href='https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzSlSeJ4XH4bWH79DKmIxjg'>here on dalicodes<a> how to use beautifulsoup, airflow and fastapi in building a data engineering system that fetches data from the web then serves the cleaner version of the data through an api.
